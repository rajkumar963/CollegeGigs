        The Journey of Ritesh Agarwal and OYO Rooms
      </h1>
            <span className="block text-start font-semibold mb-8">
                Ritesh Agarwal grew up in Odisha with big dreams and an entrepreneurial spirit. Unlike most kids his age,
                he was more interested in solving problems than following the traditional path of school, college, and a
                stable job. His love for innovation and his determination to make an impact led him to take a bold
                step—one that would change the hospitality industry forever.
            </span>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">1. The Beginning of OYO </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
            <span> 
                At just 18, Ritesh launched Oravel Stays in 2012, a platform that helped people find affordable places to
                stay. He quickly realized that while budget accommodations were available, they lacked consistency in
                quality and service. That’s when the idea struck—why not standardize these budget stays to make them
                more reliable for travelers?
                 <br /> <br />
            </span>
            <span> 
                His vision soon gained recognition, and he secured a Rs 30 lakh grant. But things really took off in 2013
                when he was selected for the Thiel Fellowship, a program started by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. With a
                $100,000 grant, he transformed Oravel Stays into OYO Rooms, a brand focused on providing comfortable,
                affordable stays.
            </span>
        </ul>
      
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Growth and Success.</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
            <p> 
                OYO started small, with just five hotels in Gurgaon, India. With an initial investment of Rs 82 lakh, Ritesh
                worked tirelessly to refine the business model. Unlike traditional hotel chains, OYO didn’t own
                properties—it partnered with hotels, ensuring they met certain standards so customers had a consistent
                experience wherever they stayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model worked. By 2016, OYO had expanded beyond India, opening in Malaysia. Soon, it spread across
                China, Indonesia, the UK, the US, Europe, and the Middle East. By 2020, OYO had over 43,000 properties
                with one million rooms across 800 cities in 80 countries. It attracted big investors like SoftBank Group,
                Sequoia India, and Airbnb, turning Ritesh’s dream into a global success.

        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Facing Challenges.</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
            <p>
                Like any business, OYO had its fair share of challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the travel industry
                hard, forcing hotels to shut down and reducing demand for rooms. OYO also faced legal troubles,
                including disputes with hotel owners over contracts and allegations of mismanagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Internally, the company had to make tough decisions, including layoffs and leadership changes. Its
                valuation dropped from $10 billion in 2019 to $3 billion in 2020, and financial losses piled up. But Ritesh
                didn’t give up. He focused on restructuring the business, cutting costs, and making operations more
                efficient.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3">
            <p>
                Despite the ups and downs, Ritesh continued to support young entrepreneurs. He joined Shark Tank India
                Season 3, where his friendly and encouraging attitude made him stand out. Unlike other investors who
                called themselves "sharks," he said, “I’m more like a dolphin. I want to support founders and help them
                grow.”
                <br /><br />
                His advice to entrepreneurs? “Great ideas matter, but the person behind the company matters even
                more.”           
            </p>
